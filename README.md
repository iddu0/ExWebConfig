# ExWebConfig
This is a project I decided to randomly make after setting up my old DNS-323 D-link NAS. It is basiclly a thing where you can access a devices Web configuration page in your web browser without going to the IP (192.168..). Changes made in this "web device configuration page" will not affect your actual device. This is just the Device's web configuration UI ported and modified to be ran over HTTPS on a website (https://iddu01.github.io/ExWebConfig) instead of something like http://192.168.1.10/webconfigutil.
# Supported Devices
Currently, The only Web Configuration page of a device are the D-link DNS-323 (WIP), and the HP OfficeJet 8022e (I haven't started on this one yet)
(dumb project, i know)
